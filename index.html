        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Eyes That Changed Color</strong></p>
        <p><br /> Reynald Dragniel &ndash; that is my name. My Parents and guys at school call me &ldquo;Rey&rdquo;. Well, the guys at my old school used to call me that, but not here, at the private school known as Tootkyou Academy.</p>
        <p><br /> I don't know why but my parents one day asked me out of the blue to go to this academy, which was located in Japan of all places. I did oppose to the idea of leaving my country to pursue further education in some other country, but things happened and I ended up leaving my home in New Orleans and being admitted to this academy as a second-year transfer student.<br /> At first, it was a bit lonely for me there as I was scared I would be treated as an outcast because I was a foreigner but eventually, I got used to it as I learned that I was not the only student from a different country there. And it was not long after it that I kind of was glad that I was in this school and it was all because of a girl I met there.</p>
        <p><br /> Her name was Linda Fellia, a beautiful girl with silky black hair and a slender body. She was my classmate and that is how I met her. She was British but lived with her mother's relatives here in Japan.</p>
        <p><br /> As for me, I lived in the school dormitory and my only driving force which kept me going in this school was her. Every day I would wake up and hope to meet her and know more about her. But all my efforts would go in vain as I wasn't the only one in the queue, there were others who were just as attracted to her as I was. Every time I&rsquo;d think about talking to her I would just back down and think, &ldquo;Why would someone like her even think about befriending me?&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> However, something really unexpected happened two months after my transfer to this school.<br /> </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please go out with me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> Yes! It was Linda!</p>
        <p><br /> At first, I thought it was some kind of prank she was trying to pull off but the seriousness in her eyes said otherwise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was trying my best to keep my cool and talk calmly but the excitement was just too much to handle. I said yes right away!<br /> </p>
        <p>She said how she was attracted to me and all but I overheard her all I could think about was how beautiful she was. We came up with a plan to meet up the next day then we talked a bit more and bid each other goodbye. That night, as expected, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. All I could think about was how our &ldquo;date&rdquo; was going to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I woke up early the next morning and got myself all dressed up. I arrived at the spot two hours before the time we agreed on. It was a crossroad near the academy.</p>
        <p>While waiting a stunningly beautiful girl walked past me. Her captivating untied crimson hair flying behind her. It was long and of a shade I'd never seen before. Her walk was graceful with long lean legs covered with black leggings and boots. As she passed she barely just looked towards me. I almost gasped at the most enchanting sea-green eyes I'd ever seen. Her face was pale like that of a doll, with full blood red lips matching her hair. I couldn&rsquo;t help but just stare. As she passed by I turned around to see Linda, both of them were looking at each other. I quickly grabbed hold of my senses and called Linda hoping that she hadn&rsquo;t noticed me seeing the other girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hey Rey!&rdquo; she called.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She arrived 15 minutes after the decided time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hi Linda, how have you been?&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Sorry for being late, an issue came up at the last minute.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Oh. Don't worry about that I just came here too.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> After that we went for a movie and then shopping. After shopping we went for lunch. We had a lot of fun together and before we knew it was already evening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We started heading back home, we hadn&rsquo;t even reached mid-way and Linda said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Would you mind if we take a little detour on our way back? There is a place I want you to see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Yeah sure, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> She took me to a place not too far away from the academy. It was a graveyard. I thought to myself &ldquo;Why would she bring me here?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before I could ask her she had let go of my hand (yes, we were holding hands!) and she was standing in front of me.<br /> I asked her why she had got us here but she didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After a moment of silence she asked,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It sure was fun today, wasn't it?&rdquo; with a smile on her face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, it sure was.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br /> Then she came towards me and placed her left hand on my face and said with a cute tone in her voice,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hey Reynald, Can I ask you something?&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Yes! You can ask me anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Would you die for me?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And there was silence..</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Huh? I Think I didn't hear you right. Sorry but can you repeat that again?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;Can I kill you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br /> She didn&rsquo;t even stutter. I thought she must be joking but I couldn&rsquo;t convince myself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then suddenly I noticed that the tender sensation of her hand on my face had changed into something I can&rsquo;t express in words. Her eyes drastically changed from the warm dark brown to a ferocious look of pure malice. The iris turned into a scary unnatural shade of topaz. She wasn't human anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br /> Before I could understand what was happening, her hand that was touching my face was choking my throat and had lifted me from the ground. As I looked down, the hand that was grabbing my neck was no longer of a human, it was more like a claw of a monster from some horror movie and her eyes had changed into the eyes of some bloodthirsty beast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I still was trying to make sense out of everything and she said in a hoarse voice,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The little time we spent together was fun while it lasted, like a stupid child's play.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was enough to break me into pieces on the inside. After this I didn&rsquo;t care, even if she&rsquo;d kill me.</p>
        <p><br /> Then suddenly a terrible pain ripped through my body. I looked down to see Linda's hand gruesomely embedded into my abdomen. She pulled it out with a jerk causing even more blood to spill out. The pain was agonising and it felt like my whole body was on fire.</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Such a waste of life! But what has to be done, has to be done.&rdquo; she said and lifted her hand to land one final blow.<br /> </p>
        <p>I wanted to ask her why she was doing this but I could barely speak. I couldn&rsquo;t even feel my body. My eyesight had become blurry and I was almost unconscious but could still hear everything she was saying. All my past life was flashing in front of my eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t anything to be proud of really.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br /> Suddenly something pushed Linda away and I fell on the ground.</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;That is as far as you go! I will not you allow you to cause any more harm to this man.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the voice of some girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I couldn&rsquo;t do anything but lie there in my own blood and listen to their conversation.</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;Urgh! I didn't hope to have someone like you accompany me on my date today, regardless that man is as good as dead.&rdquo; That hoarse voice again.</p>
        <p><br /> &ldquo;We'll see about that, let's attend to the matter at hand first, you that is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After that I couldn&rsquo;t hear a thing. My body was becoming numb by every second. I could still feel the wetness of my blood on my hands though and when I lifted my hand to see it, it was all covered in blood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Red, the same color as the girl's hair. The red on my hands exactly matched her beautiful long tresses. That deep and dark crimson hair was like flowing wine, not very different from the blood oozing out of my own body.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And just before I lost consciousness, I saw a flash of brilliant crimson hair waving in the air in front of me.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <br /> <br /> </p>
